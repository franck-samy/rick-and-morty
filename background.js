// Background is just a class, because its going to have its internal behaviours and it shouldnt be controlled by anything outside of itself.
// the Game **holds** the background, but its up to the background to behave according to the logic that you want it to do
// some examples of different logic here, would be to add other background images, different flows, different ways of looping (vertical, reversed, super fast, etc)
class Background {
    constructor() {
        // console.log("HERE");
        //  this.height = height;
        //  this.width = width;
        this.x = 0;
    }

    // the setup meta-method is called in the game.js in order to initialize the height and width properties of the Background object
    setup() {
        this.height = height;
        this.width = width;
    }

    draw() {
        // makes the background move to the left, creating the illusion of movement!

        // we draw the first image that appears in the game at launch
        image(bgImage, this.x, 0, this.width, this.height);
        // we draw another image to the right of the previous one, to create the loop effect whenever it moves left
        image(bgImage, this.x + this.width, 0, this.width, this.height);

        //  Because we are always subtracting from the x (and we start at 0) we know that whenever it reaches -width it actually already subtracted the WHOLE image.
        // Therefore, we update the x position back to 0, to give the continuing loop a reset
        if (this.x <= -this.width) {
            // reset the background back to its starting point, to give the illusion of never ending loop
            this.x = 0;
        }
        //  Another way of writing this check this
        // so if the right hand side of the first background image is at position 0, we should reset it back to its original spot
        // if (this.x + this.width <= 0) {
        // this.x = 0
        // }
    }
